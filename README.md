Data Recovery Research Tools
A collection of tools to generate patterns, manage XOR files, analyze dumps, visualize things to help for data recovery

## List of the tools

### XOR Patcher
The XOR Patcher takes a dump file and replaces parts of it into other parts of it. Parts are e.g. ECC, DATA, SA
How to use the tool

### XOR Stat tool
The XOR stat tool analyzes a complete dump file and searches for the patterns that were generated by the patterning tools above.
It will generate lots of statistics you can look at later.
