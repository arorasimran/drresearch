Data Recovery Research Tools
A collection of tools to generate patterns, manage XOR files, analyze dumps, visualize things to help for data recovery

## List of the tools

### XOR Patcher
The XOR Patcher takes a dump file and replaces parts of it into other parts of it. Parts are e.g. ECC, DATA, SA
How to use the tool

### XOR Stat tool
The XOR stat tool analyzes a complete dump file and searches for the patterns that were generated by the patterning tools above.
It will generate lots of statistics you can look at later.
For the XOR stat tool to work, the filename of the dump file MUST contain the pagesize, like e.g. Pendrive(13016b).dmp
When you run the XOR tool without any parameters it will analyze all the .dmp files in the current directory.
To analyze a specific command run>
```
perl xorstat.pl Pendrive(13016b).dmp
```
Afterwards a file Pendrive(13016b).dmp.html is generated and you can open that in your favourite browser.
